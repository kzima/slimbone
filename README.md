4. Separation of frontend and logic
5. Does not force MVC pattern

##What's included?
1. slim framework - for routing and data management
2. mongoDB - for flexible schema and collection storage 
3. backbone - for javascript structure 
4. underscore - utility library to help with javascript coding
5. requirejs - for javascript dependency manager and module loading
6. composer - package manger for backend stuff
7. bower - package manager for frontend stuff
8. i18n - for localisation
9. twig - for better and more secure php templating
10. twitter bootstrap - for frontend development
11. font awesome - for vector icons
12. easy file structure - with separate template for admin and app
13. grunt - for improved workflow with js/css compilation

##Why slimbone?
Right now there is no ideal solution that is flexible enough to build complex web apps more easily.
I went through multiple php and javascript technologies and I would like to share my findings with you.

I was using Yii framework for a while and I realized MVC structure is not for me.
I also found that Yii (v1.1) is not restful ready and in fairness I just used up to 20% of the framework's functionality in my development.
I decided to switch to something lean.

I came across of Meteor js and I must admit that I really liked it. The concept of having an app built in pure javascript is very appealing. 
Unfortunately I don't think it's ready for production yet (v0.6.5) and I don't think I am ready to fully switch to javascript.
I decided to save meteor to my bookmarks for now and I kept looking.

Then I tried Laravel, and ... it just didn't work for me. Again I was forced with the folder structure and I didn't have time
to go through documentation and stack overflow on how to do things.

Then I checked Fat Free micro Framework and I found it very slim (only 55kb) and flexible. The only problem was that I was unable to manage FF3 dependency in composer. 

So I followed the micro framework breadcrumb and I found Slim framework. Bingo! It's sleek, intuitive, easy to learn and very flexible.
I put all the bits and pieces together and build this skeleton to save my time next time. 
Because the beackend is structured using slim and forntend use backbone I couldn't call it other than "slimbone" :)

##What can you do with slimbone?
You can now focus on building apps with complex UI and save time thanks to separation of the frontend and beckend. 
For each new project you can now update all the dependencies in the frontend and backend much easier than before.
You can build restful API's very quickly thanks to dynamic collection route mapping and mongoDB.
