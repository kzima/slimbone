2. Easy to install, maintain and extend
3. Follows best practices
4. Separation of frontend and logic
5. Does not force MVC pattern

##What's included?
1. slim framework - for routing and data management
2. mongoDB - for flexible schema and collection storage 
3. backbone - for javascript structure 
4. underscore - utility library to help with javascript coding
5. requirejs - for javascript dependency manager and module loading
6. composer - package manger for backend stuff
7. bower - package manager for frontend stuff
8. i18n - for localisation
9. twig - for better and more secure php templating
10. twitter bootstrap - for frontend development
11. font awesome - for vector icons
12. easy file structure - with separate template for admin and app

##Why slimbone?
Right now there is no ideal solution that is flexible enough to build complex web apps more easily.
I went through multiple php and javascript technologies and I would like to share my findings with you.

I was using Yii framework for a while and I realized MVC structure is not for me.
Besides Yii (v1.1) is not restfull ready and in fairness I just used up to 20% of the framework's functionality.
I decided to switch to something lean.

I came across of Meteor js and I must admit that I really like it. The concept of having an app built in pure javascript is ver appealing. 
Unfortunately I don't think it's ready for production yet (v0.6.5) and I don't think I am ready to fully switch to javascript.
I decided to save meteor to my bookmarks for now and I kept looking.

Then I tried Laravel, and ... it just didn't work for me. Again I was foced with the folder structure and I didn't have time
to go through documentation and stack overflow on how to do things.

Then I checked Fat Free micro Framework and I found it very slim (only 55kb) and flexible. The only problem was that I wanted to be able to manage
it in my composer dependency and FF3 wasn't available in packagist.org.

So I followed the micro framework breadcrumb and I found Slim framework. Bingo! It's sleek, inuitive, easy to learn and very flexible.
I put all the bits and pieces together and build this sceleton to save my time with the next app. 
Because the beackend is structured using slim and forntend use backbone I counld't call it diffrently than "slimbone".

##What you can do with slimbone?
You can now focus on building apps with complex UI and save time thanks to seperation of the frontend and beckend. 
For each new project you can now update all the dependecies in the front end and backend much easier than before.
You can build restful API's very quickly thanks to collection route mapping.
